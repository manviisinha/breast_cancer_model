# Breast Cancer Prediction Using Machine Learning

## 📌 Overview
This project uses machine learning techniques to predict whether a tumor is *benign* or *malignant* based on breast cancer diagnostic data.  
It applies supervised learning models, performs data preprocessing, and evaluates model performance using accuracy and other metrics.

---

## 📂 Dataset
- *Source*: [Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data)  
- *Features*: Includes measurements like radius, texture, smoothness, compactness, and symmetry.  
- *Target Variable*: diagnosis — M (Malignant) or B (Benign).  

---

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- *Python*  
- *Pandas & NumPy* for data manipulation  
- *Matplotlib & Seaborn* for visualization  
- *Scikit-learn* for model building and evaluation  

---

## 🚀 Steps Involved
1. *Import Dataset* – Load the breast cancer dataset into a pandas DataFrame.  
2. *Data Cleaning* – Handle missing values, duplicates, and irrelevant columns.  
3. *Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)* – Visualize data distributions and correlations.  
4. *Data Preprocessing* – Encode categorical variables and normalize features.  
5. *Model Training* – Train models such as:
   - Logistic Regression  
   - Decision Tree Classifier  
   - Random Forest Classifier  
   - Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
6. *Model Evaluation* – Compare performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## 📊 Results
| Model | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1-Score |
|-------|----------|-----------|--------|----------|
| Logistic Regression | 97% | 97% | 96% | 96% |
| Random Forest | 98% | 98% | 97% | 97% |
| SVM | 97% | 97% | 97% | 97% |

(Results may vary depending on random state and dataset split)

## 📌 Future Improvements
- Implement deep learning models (ANNs) for better accuracy.  
- Deploy as a *web application* using Flask or Streamlit.  
- Add more feature engineering techniques.
